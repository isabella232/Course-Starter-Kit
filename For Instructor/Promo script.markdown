# Course Promo Video

For each course we make or update on our site, we create a special promotional video to help spread the word about your new course.

Promo videos should follow this structure:

1. **Describe a problem** the target student has likely encountered.
2. **Show the solution** - your course - and what the student will be able to do by the end.
3. **Give a few details** by listing the course highlights.
4. **Call to action.**

## Script

*Add your promo script to this file, replacing the template below!* 

*Feel free to tweak the template to better suit your course and speaking style, as long as you follow the 4 steps listed above. But do NOT change the ending sentence!*

--

Have you ever _? [describe the most common problem your course solves in one to two sentences.]

Complete my course so you can _ *or* Follow along with my course to _ [describe what they'll be able to do by the end of the course. Should relate directly to the problem mentioned in the sentence above.]

You’ll learn _ [list out the main content topics of the course - just the highlights, not a comprehensive list]

This course is available now for raywenderlich.com subscribers. (Reminder: don't change this sentence)

--

**Please note:** that the final sentence will match up with a premade animation, so do not change the wording of that sentence. And do not add any sentences after it - if you want to add additional information, do it before you say, "This course is available now for raywenderlich.com subscribers.")

**For Courses in a Learning Path** - change the ending to instead say **exactly** this:

This course is part of our _ Learning Path which takes complete beginners and turns them into professional developers. And it's available now for raywenderlich.com subscribers.


## Demo Footage

During the “Complete my course” section, we want to show two types of footage (with your voice in the background).

Please specify the video segments you want to use for each type, using timestamps from your unedited demo recordings
(Record footage specially for the promo video, if you need to.): 

* **Demo:** [TODO: A final product demo. For example, the final app of your course if it looks cool, otherwise some other motivating final result.]
* **Code:** [TODO: Typing some code or working in your IDE.]
